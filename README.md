## Proprietary Algorithms & AI Engine

### Advisor Engine Architecture
Our **AdvisorEngineV1** implements a sophisticated pipeline for generating personalized insights:

### **1. Proprietary Pattern Recognition Engine** (`utils/patternEngine.ts`)

Our unique algorithm analyzes mood entries to generate actionable insights:

* **Intra-day Pattern Detection:** Identifies if mood improves, declines, or remains stable throughout the day
* **Temporal Correlation Analysis:** Finds optimal times and days for peak emotional states
* **Activity-Mood Correlation:** Links specific activities (boosters/drainers) to mood outcomes
* **Dynamic Insight Generation:** Creates personalized, contextual recommendations

**Key Algorithms:**
```typescript
export interface AdvisorEngine {
  detect: (rows: any[], period: Period) => AdvisorEvent[]
  rerank: (events: AdvisorEvent[]) => AdvisorEvent[]
  pickTips: (ctx: { period: Period, events: AdvisorEvent[] }) => void
  compose: (period: Period, events: AdvisorEvent[]) => AdvisorItem[]
}
```

## Partner Connect System

### What it is

* A secure way for two people to connect in‑app via a short invitation flow (link/QR)
* Automatic generation of "insight postcards" about a partner's day based on their own mood entries
* A Daily/Weekly/Monthly view that summarizes meaningful highlights in a friendly, non‑intrusive format

### How it works (Architecture)

* Firebase (RN, Expo): Anonymous auth + Firestore documents
* Real‑time partner presence: onSnapshot listener on `users/<uid>` to track partner linkage
* Sharing model:

  * Daily rollups under `users/<partnerId>/insights_daily/YYYY-MM-DD`
  * Optional postcard stream under `users/<partnerId>/postcards`
* Offline‑friendly: resilient auth and listeners; all personal logging works without partner features

## Unique Selling Points & Differentiators

### Agentic Co‑pilot (New)
Turn insights into action with one tap—across self and partner contexts. Actions are privacy‑preserving (local state only), low friction (open Maps/Calendar/SMS), and context‑aware (labels adapt to partner).

- Focus Time (flagship)
  - What: Protect your best hours by creating a calendar block from rhythm insights
  - Self label: "Block this time"  • Partner label: "Block this time for us"
  - Example: Week rhythm → "Best hours: 10:00–13:00" → [Block this time]
- Order Your Booster (maps + calendar)
  - What: Remove friction to do what helps—schedule or find a place nearby
  - Self labels: "Schedule time for nature", "Find nature nearby"
  - Partner labels: "Plan nature time together", "Find a nature spot for you both"
  - Booster→Maps examples: nature→park near me; exercise→gym near me; social→coffee shop near me; reading→library near me
- Prep for Drainer (calendar buffer)
  - What: Add a short decompression/reset buffer around stressors
  - Self/Partner labels: "Add a short decompress buffer" / "...for both of you"
  - Quick‑win presets: work_stress→"Add 5‑min decompress buffer"; screen_time→"Plan a 3 PM reset"; commute→"Add 10‑min post‑commute buffer"
- Partner applicability
  - Partner postcards now render actions inline (booster, drainer, rhythm)
  - Example: "Heads‑up: work_stress..." → [Ask about their day] + [Add 5‑min decompress buffer]

### Data Flow Architecture

* On‑device (always, for individuals and partners):

  * Mood entry storage (AsyncStorage via Zustand)
  * Pattern/insight detection and template selection
  * Notification scheduling, streaks, and local Day/Week/Month aggregation
* Firestore (only when Partner Connect is enabled):

  * Lightweight connection docs (`users/<uid>.partner`, `connectionRequests`)
  * Delivery of curated insights only (type, text, emoji, optional highlights, timestamps)
  * No raw mood entries, no journal notes, no full activity histories are uploaded
* Offline behavior:

  * Personal logging continues to work fully offline
  * If offline during delivery, the insight is skipped for that moment; can be regenerated on next qualifying save when online (future: optional outbox)

Why it matters: This closes the loop from “insight” to “execution,” differentiating us from data‑only trackers. It also elevates partner value with supportive, shared actions.

### 1. Explainable AI vs. Traditional Charts
**Traditional Approach (What We Avoid)**: Most mood tracking apps rely solely on data visualization - charts, graphs, and raw statistics that users must interpret themselves.

**Our Approach**: We provide **explainable insights** that translate data into actionable understanding:

```typescript
// Example of our explainable insight generation
{
  title: "Daytime stress nudged up",
  text: "Looks like stress ticked up 15%. It often follows later bedtimes this week.",
  tips: [
    { text: "If it's past 11pm, dim lights and put the phone away for 20 minutes." },
    { text: "Set out tomorrow's clothes before 10:30 pm to ease the morning." }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Balanced Visualization Strategy
We strike the perfect balance between familiarity and innovation:

- **Charts for Familiarity**: Users see traditional mood distributions and trends
- **Explainable Insights for Innovation**: AI-generated narratives that provide new understanding
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple insights, gradually introduce complexity

### 3. Proprietary Correlation Engine
Our correlation detection goes beyond simple frequency counting:

- **Temporal Correlation**: Identifies when activities are most effective
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers mood state when evaluating activity impact
- **Emerging Pattern Detection**: Spots new correlations before they become obvious

### 4. Relationship Intelligence
Unique partner insights that go beyond individual tracking:

- **Shared Pattern Recognition**: Identifies relationship dynamics
- **Communication Prompts**: AI-generated conversation starters
- **Collaborative Insights**: Joint well-being optimization

### 5. Adaptive Learning System
Our feedback mechanism continuously improves insight quality:

- **User Preference Learning**: Tracks which insights users find helpful
- **Category Weighting**: Adjusts insight types based on user engagement
- **Cooldown Optimization**: Prevents insight fatigue through intelligent timing

### 6. Intelligent Notification System
Our sophisticated notification engine goes beyond simple reminders:

  classDef cloud fill:#E3F2FD,stroke:#1565C0,color:#0D47A1
  class Sender,Receiver local
  class Cloud cloud

```

* Proprietary algorithms here:

  * Pattern/Insights Engine runs on sender's device to generate curated text
  * Daily Rollup Strategy: replace-by-type, cap 3 items/day, update counts (in Firestore)
  * Weekly/Monthly Aggregation: computed on device from rollup counts + representative cards

### Our proprietary logic (High‑level)

* Insight Engine: Lightweight, deterministic rules detect meaningful daily signals and produce one postcard/day when criteria are met

  * Priority 1: Turnaround detection (low to high mood in same day)
  * Priority 2: Single biggest positive moment (booster‑driven)
  * Priority 3: Gentle nudge when mood trends low
  * Priority 4: Rhythm note (time‑of‑day and overall state)
* Daily Rollup Strategy: Store at most 3 curated items per day with type‑based replacement to avoid spam and reduce read/write costs
* Aggregation: Weekly/Monthly summaries render a concise "story" using daily counts plus a representative card per type
* Cost discipline: Minimize fan‑out, cap items, and prefer rollups over raw streams

### Outcomes this system fosters

* Empathy: Partners get a gentle, contextual window into each other's days without prying
* Support: Timely, specific highlights suggest how to be helpful ("exercise helped today", "evening tends to be hard")
* Connection: Creates lightweight prompts for check‑ins and encouragement
* Autonomy and privacy: Each person controls their sharing; no raw journals or PII are exposed

### Why this is innovative

## 🔒 Privacy FAQ

* Is the app completely offline?

  * Individual use: Yes. All logging, analysis, insights, and notifications are on-device. Internet is not required.
  * Partner Connect: Partially online. Insight generation remains on-device, but the curated result (type, text, emoji, optional highlights) is sent via Firestore so your partner can receive it. If offline, personal logging still works; partner delivery waits until you're online (currently re-generated on next qualifying save; optional outbox can be added).

* Do you upload my journal notes or raw mood history?

  * No. Only the curated insight text and minimal metadata are shared when Partner Connect is enabled.

* Can I use the app entirely without Partner Connect?

  * Absolutely. Partner Connect is optional. The app is a complete individual wellness tool on its own.

* What partner data is stored in Firestore?

  * Minimal linkage docs (`connectionRequests` and `users/<uid>.partner`) and the curated insight records for delivery to the partner.

* Can I disconnect a partner later?

  * Yes. Removing the partner link stops further deliveries. Existing delivered insights remain on the recipient's device history unless they choose to clear it.

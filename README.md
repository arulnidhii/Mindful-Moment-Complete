## ❤️‍🔥 **From Individual Wellness to Relationship Wellness**

Mindful Moment now serves two complementary audiences:
- Individuals seeking a private, premium, insight‑driven mental wellness companion
- Couples who want to gently support each other’s well‑being via privacy‑respecting insights

Partner Connect is 100% optional. The single‑user experience remains first‑class. When enabled, it unlocks a new layer of relational awareness designed to foster empathy, shared understanding, and healthy support dynamics.

## 🧠 **Core Features & Innovation**

### **1. Proprietary Pattern Recognition Engine** (`utils/patternEngine.ts`)
Our unique algorithm analyzes mood entries to generate actionable insights:

- **Intra-day Pattern Detection:** Identifies if mood improves, declines, or remains stable throughout the day
- **Temporal Correlation Analysis:** Finds optimal times and days for peak emotional states
- **Activity-Mood Correlation:** Links specific activities (boosters/drainers) to mood outcomes
- **Dynamic Insight Generation:** Creates personalized, contextual recommendations

**Key Algorithms:**
```typescript
// Mood trend analysis with statistical significance
function findIntraDayPattern(entries: MoodEntry[]): InsightCard | null
// Temporal optimization for peak performance
function findPatternInsight(entries: MoodEntry[]): InsightCard | null
// Activity effectiveness scoring
function findTopBooster(entries: MoodEntry[]): InsightCard | null
```

### **2. Smart Tag Relevance System** (`utils/tagRelevanceEngine.ts`)
Advanced tag management that prevents pollution and maintains relevance:

- **Intelligent Categorization:** Groups tags into Wellness, Social, Work, Technology, Health
- **Relevance Scoring:** 60% recent frequency + 30% total frequency + 10% recency
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Most Relevant, Trending, and Past Favorites modes
- **Collapsible UI:** Prevents overwhelming users with too many options

**Innovation:** Unlike other apps that show all tags, we intelligently surface the most meaningful ones based on user behavior patterns.

### **3. Personalized Notification System** (`utils/notifications.ts`)
Context-aware notifications that adapt to user patterns:

- **Smart Scheduling:** Daily reminders, weekly insights, gentle encouragement
- **Pattern-Based Triggers:** Proactive suggestions when negative trends are detected
- **Streak Celebrations:** Motivational notifications for consistency
- **Missed Check-in Recovery:** Gentle re-engagement for lapsed users

**Notification Types:**
- **N-01:** Daily Reminder (user-scheduled)
- **N-02:** Streak Celebration (immediate)
- **N-03:** Weekly Teaser (Sunday 8 AM)
- **N-04:** Gentle Encouragement (Wednesday 3 PM)
- **N-05:** Missed Check-in Recovery (next evening)

### **4. Enhanced User Experience Components**

#### **ActivitySelector.tsx** - Intelligent Tag Display
- **3x3 Grid System:** Shows maximum 9 tags initially for immediate Continue button visibility
- **Progressive Disclosure:** "+X more" button reveals additional options
- **Smart Prioritization:** Suggested > Custom > Default tag ordering
- **Visual Indicators:** ✨ for suggested, 🟢 for custom tags

## 🤝 **Partner Connect System (Proprietary)**

A privacy‑preserving, lightweight, and cost‑efficient system that transforms Mindful Moment into a Relationship Wellness app—without compromising the core single‑user experience.

### What it is
- A secure way for two people to connect in‑app via a short invitation flow (link/QR)
- Automatic generation of “insight postcards” about a partner’s day based on their own mood entries
- A Daily/Weekly/Monthly view that summarizes meaningful highlights in a friendly, non‑intrusive format

### How it works (Architecture)
- Firebase (RN, Expo): Anonymous auth + Firestore documents
- Real‑time partner presence: onSnapshot listener on users/<uid> to track partner linkage
- Sharing model:
  - Daily rollups under users/<partnerId>/insights_daily/YYYY-MM-DD
  - Optional postcard stream under users/<partnerId>/postcards
- Offline‑friendly: resilient auth and listeners; all personal logging works without partner features


### Processing and Privacy: On‑Device vs. Firestore

- On‑device (always, for individuals and partners):
  - Mood entry storage (AsyncStorage via Zustand)
  - Pattern/insight detection and template selection
  - Notification scheduling, streaks, and local Day/Week/Month aggregation
- Firestore (only when Partner Connect is enabled):
  - Lightweight connection docs (users/<uid>.partner, connectionRequests)
  - Delivery of curated insights only (type, text, emoji, optional highlights, timestamps)
  - No raw mood entries, no journal notes, no full activity histories are uploaded
- Offline behavior:
  - Personal logging continues to work fully offline
  - If offline during delivery, the insight is skipped for that moment; can be regenerated on next qualifying save when online (future: optional outbox)

> TL;DR: Insights are generated on‑device. Firestore is a private, minimal transport layer to deliver curated results to your partner—never the raw data.


### Privacy by Design — Data Flow Diagrams

#### Individual Usage (100% On‑Device)

- Proprietary algorithms here:
  - Pattern Engine detects trends, correlations, rhythm (local)
  - Insights Engine selects templates and fills variables (local)
  - Notification scheduler adapts timing based on local patterns

#### Partner Connect (On‑Device Generation + Minimal Cloud Transport for connection purposes)

```

- Proprietary algorithms here:
  - Pattern/Insights Engine runs on sender’s device to generate curated text
  - Daily Rollup Strategy: replace-by-type, cap 3 items/day, update counts (in Firestore)
  - Weekly/Monthly Aggregation: computed on device from rollup counts + representative cards

### Our proprietary logic (High‑level)
- Insight Engine: Lightweight, deterministic rules detect meaningful daily signals and produce one postcard/day when criteria are met
  - Priority 1: Turnaround detection (low to high mood in same day)
  - Priority 2: Single biggest positive moment (booster‑driven)
  - Priority 3: Gentle nudge when mood trends low
  - Priority 4: Rhythm note (time‑of‑day and overall state)
- Daily Rollup Strategy: Store at most 3 curated items per day with type‑based replacement to avoid spam and reduce read/write costs
- Aggregation: Weekly/Monthly summaries render a concise “story” using daily counts plus a representative card per type
- Cost discipline: Minimize fan‑out, cap items, and prefer rollups over raw streams

### Outcomes this system fosters
- Empathy: Partners get a gentle, contextual window into each other’s days without prying
- Support: Timely, specific highlights suggest how to be helpful (“exercise helped today”, “evening tends to be hard”)
- Connection: Creates lightweight prompts for check‑ins and encouragement
- Autonomy and privacy: Each person controls their sharing; no raw journals or PII are exposed

### Why this is innovative
- Relationship‑centric insights layered on a best‑in‑class individual wellness core
- Opinionated, human‑centric curation that avoids “insight spam”
- Optional, reversible, and cost‑aware by design—scales without degrading UX or budgets

## 🔒 Privacy FAQ

- Is the app completely offline?
  - Individual use: Yes. All logging, analysis, insights, and notifications are on-device. Internet is not required.
  - Partner Connect: Partially online. Insight generation remains on-device, but the curated result (type, text, emoji, optional highlights) is sent via Firestore so your partner can receive it. If offline, personal logging still works; partner delivery waits until you’re online (currently re-generated on next qualifying save; optional outbox can be added).

- Do you upload my journal notes or raw mood history?
  - No. Only the curated insight text and minimal metadata are shared when Partner Connect is enabled.

- Can I use the app entirely without Partner Connect?
  - Absolutely. Partner Connect is optional. The app is a complete individual wellness tool on its own.

- What partner data is stored in Firestore?
  - Minimal linkage docs (connectionRequests and users/<uid>.partner) and the curated insight records for delivery to the partner.

- Can I disconnect a partner later?
  - Yes. Removing the partner link stops further deliveries. Existing delivered insights remain on the recipient’s device history unless they choose to clear it.

# Universal Links / App Links setup for app.quantifylabs.ai

This folder contains ready-to-deploy files to enable robust deep-linking for both Android and iOS.

You only need to deploy these files to your domain (https://app.quantifylabs.ai). The app code is already configured.

## What this enables
- Tapping an invite like https://app.quantifylabs.ai/connect/<REQUEST_ID> opens the app to the invitation screen.
- If the app is not installed, the page automatically redirects to the store after trying to open the app.

## Files
- .well-known/assetlinks.json — required by Android for App Links verification
- .well-known/apple-app-site-association — required by iOS for Associated Domains
- connect/index.html — a small web fallback that redirects into the app scheme and then to the store if the app is not installed

## Where to deploy
Deploy these files under the exact paths on your HTTPS domain:

- https://app.quantifylabs.ai/.well-known/assetlinks.json
- https://app.quantifylabs.ai/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
- https://app.quantifylabs.ai/connect/index.html (with a server/hosting rewrite so that /connect/* serves this same file)

Most static hosts (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel) support wildcard rewrites:

- Cloudflare Pages: Add a `_routes.json` next to connect/index.html with:
  {
    "version": 1,
    "include": ["/*"],
    "exclude": []
  }
  and a top-level `_redirects` file containing:
  /connect/*   /connect/index.html   200

- Netlify: Add a top-level `_redirects` with the same line above.

- Nginx example:
  location /connect/ {
    try_files /connect/index.html =404;
  }

## Values to fill in
Before deploying, edit the placeholders in these files:

- In `.well-known/assetlinks.json`, replace SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINT with your app signing cert fingerprint. For Play-signed releases, copy from Play Console → App Integrity (SHA‑256 certificate fingerprint). For local debug testing, use the debug keystore fingerprint.

- In `.well-known/apple-app-site-association`, replace TEAM_ID with your Apple Team ID and ensure the bundle identifier matches app.json (app.rork.mindful-moment-7y4ko4c).

## Verify
1) Android: On a device with your app installed, open `adb logcat | grep IntentFilter` or simply tap an invite link in Gmail/Chrome. If verification passed, the app opens directly.
2) iOS: After releasing a build with Associated Domains entitlement, tap the link in Mail/Safari. The app should open. You can also check device logs for `swcd` domain association entries.

Once these are deployed, your existing invite links generated by the app will work reliably across email, QR scans, and browsers.
